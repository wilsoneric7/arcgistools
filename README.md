Survey Traverse Tool for ArcGIS
This is a simple but handy tool for converting survey traverse data from CSV format into ArcGIS point features. I built this to help automate the conversion of field data without having to manually enter everything into ArcGIS.
What it does
The script reads distance and azimuth measurements from a CSV file and calculates the coordinates for each point along a traverse, starting from a known point. It's basically implementing the math that surveyors use to plot points when they have angle and distance measurements.
Improvements from the original script
I've refactored the original code with these improvements:

Wrapped everything in a function for better reusability
Added error handling to deal with bad data
Created a log file to track progress and errors
Added fields to store traverse data in the output shapefile
Included point numbering to maintain sequence
Added support for notes from the CSV
Structured the code with proper docstrings and comments

How to use it

Make sure your CSV has at least columns for 'Distance' and 'Azimuth'
The first row should contain 'Longitude' and 'Latitude' for your starting point
Optionally include a 'Notes' column for point descriptions
Update the paths at the bottom of the script
Run it with ArcGIS Python environment

CSV Format
Your CSV file should be structured like this:
CopyLongitude,Latitude,Distance,Azimuth,Notes
-122.6789,45.5678,0,0,Starting Point
,,,50,90,First measurement
,,,75,180,Second measurement
,,,60,270,Third measurement
Only the first row needs Longitude/Latitude values. Subsequent rows use the Distance and Azimuth to calculate new positions.
Installation

Clone this repo to your local machine
Make sure you have ArcGIS installed with Python access
Update the workspace and file paths in the script

pythonCopyworkspace_dir = "C:/Your/GIS/Workspace"
input_csv_file = "C:/Path/To/Your/traverse_data.csv"
Requirements

ArcGIS Pro or ArcMap with arcpy
Python 3.x (comes with ArcGIS Pro)
CSV file with properly formatted survey data

Known limitations
This uses a simple calculation that works fine for small areas but doesn't account for Earth's curvature. For more precise work over larger areas, you might want to use a proper geodetic calculation.
Future Improvements
I'm planning to add these features in the future:

Generate lines connecting the traverse points
Calculate closure error for loop traverses
Support for different distance units (currently assumes the same unit as the coordinate system)
Export to other formats like KML or GeoJSON
A simple GUI for non-programmers
Option to generate tables with calculated coordinates

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:

Check the generated log file for specific errors
Verify your CSV format matches the expected structure
Make sure your workspace directory exists and is writable
Confirm you have the necessary permissions to create files
